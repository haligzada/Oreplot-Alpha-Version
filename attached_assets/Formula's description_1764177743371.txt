1. Probability-Weighted DCF (Risk-Adjusted NPV)

A valuation method where the DCF result is multiplied by explicit probabilities of success at each project stage (e.g., exploration success, permitting, financing, construction).
It produces a more realistic value by incorporating technical, geological, and execution risks directly into the cash-flow model.

2. Monte Carlo Risk Modeling

A simulation-based analysis that runs thousands of scenarios with varying commodity prices, grades, recoveries, capex, and opex.
It generates a distribution of outcomes (P10/P50/P90 values), showing how uncertainty impacts project value and highlighting both upside potential and downside risk.

3. Income Approach — Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

A cash-flow projection model based on production schedules, operating costs, capital costs, and commodity forecasts, discounted to present value.
It represents the intrinsic economic value of the mining project under a single base-case scenario.

4. Cost Approach (Kilburn / Exploration Replacement Cost)

A method that values early-stage exploration projects based on the cost required to recreate the existing level of geological knowledge.
It considers past exploration spending, adjusts for work quality and discovery potential, and provides a minimum “floor value” when economic studies are not available.

5. Decision Tree / Stage-Gate Analysis (EMV)

A sequential decision model that maps out key project stages — such as drilling, resource definition, PEA, PFS, and construction — each with its own costs, success probabilities, and outcomes.
Expected Monetary Value (EMV) is calculated at each branch, helping investors understand the optimal path and value of progressing (or stopping) the project.
