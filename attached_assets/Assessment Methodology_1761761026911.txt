scores, weight those sub-scores, sum to a normalized investment score (0–100). That score is then used to assign a probability of success and to risk-adjust financial metrics (rNPV / EV). Below is a clear, repeatable method plus concrete formulas and a worked example you can copy into a spreadsheet.
________________________________________
1) Choose categories & weights (example for exploration)
A common weights set for early-stage projects (you can change numbers to match your investor profile):
•	Geology / prospectivity — 35
•	Resource potential / model confidence — 20
•	Economics / unit-cost & upside case — 15
•	Legal & title risk — 10
•	Permitting & ESG / community — 10
•	Data quality & QAQC — 10
Total weight = 100.

2) Score each category (scale 0–10)
For each category a geologist / tech lead gives a score from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). Convert to normalized weighted contribution.
Formula for contribution of category i
C_i=S_i/10×W_i

Where:
	S_i= score in category i(0–10)
	W_i= weight for category i
Overall Investment Score (0–100)
"Score"=∑_i C_i

3) Worked numeric example (digit-by-digit arithmetic)
Use the weights above. Suppose the assessor gives these raw scores:
	Geology S_1=7
	Resource potential S_2=5
	Economics S_3=4
	Legal/title S_4=8
	Permitting / ESG S_5=6
	Data quality S_6=5
Compute each category contribution:
	Geology: C_1=(7/10)×35
	7×35=245.
	245÷10=24.5.
	So C_1=24.5.
	Resource potential: C_2=(5/10)×20
	5×20=100.
	100÷10=10.
	So C_2=10.
	Economics: C_3=(4/10)×15
	4×15=60.
	60÷10=6.
	So C_3=6.
	Legal/title: C_4=(8/10)×10
	8×10=80.
	80÷10=8.
	So C_4=8.
	Permitting/ESG: C_5=(6/10)×10
	6×10=60.
	60÷10=6.
	So C_5=6.
	Data quality: C_6=(5/10)×10
	5×10=50.
	50÷10=5.
	So C_6=5.
Add them step-by-step:
	24.5+10=34.5.
	34.5+6=40.5.
	40.5+8=48.5.
	48.5+6=54.5.
	54.5+5=59.5.
Final Investment Score = 59.5 / 100.
Typical interpretation:
	> 70 → favourable (fast-track or term sheet)
	50–70 → proceed to deeper DD (drill program, PEA, more testwork)
	< 50 → reject or restructure (farm-out, lower price, more data required)
________________________________________
4) Convert score → probability of success → risk-adjust financials
A simple mapping used by many investors:
Probability of Success (PoS) = Score / 100.
From the worked example: PoS = 59.5/100=0.595.
If the project un-risked NPV = $50,000,000 then:
Risk-adjusted NPV (rNPV) = NPV × PoS.
Compute rNPV stepwise:
	50,000,000×0.5=25,000,000.
	50,000,000×0.09=4,500,000.
	50,000,000×0.005=250,000.
	Sum = 25,000,000+4,500,000+250,000=29,750,000.
So rNPV = $29,750,000.
(That arithmetic used decomposition: 0.595=0.5+0.09+0.005.)
