MINING PROJECT TECHNICAL SUMMARY
Project Name: Golden Ridge Exploration Project

GEOLOGY AND PROSPECTIVITY:
The project area is located in the Archean greenstone belt with favorable geological indicators. 
Outcrop mapping has identified multiple quartz-carbonate veins with visible gold mineralization.
Soil geochemistry shows strong gold anomalies (>100 ppb Au) over a 2 km strike length.
Historical trenching returned grades of 5-15 g/t Au over 2-5 meter widths.
Rock chip samples from surface outcrop yielded up to 45 g/t Au.

RESOURCE POTENTIAL:
Limited drilling completed to date (5 holes, 800m total).
Preliminary geological model suggests potential for 500,000 - 1,000,000 oz Au resource.
Mineralization remains open along strike and at depth.
Confidence level: Inferred - requires significant additional drilling.

ECONOMICS:
Preliminary CAPEX estimate: $25M for small-scale underground operation.
Estimated OPEX: $800/oz based on comparable operations.
Gold price assumption: $2,000/oz.
Potential operating margin: $1,200/oz.
No formal economic study completed (PEA or PFS).

LEGAL AND TITLE:
Mining claims in good standing, expiry date 2028.
100% ownership with no underlying royalties.
No known encumbrances or disputes.
Chain of title verified through provincial mining records.

PERMITTING AND ESG:
Exploration permit in place, valid until 2027.
Environmental baseline study completed in 2023.
Initial community consultations completed with local First Nations.
No formal Impact Benefit Agreement in place yet.
Social license to operate appears positive but requires ongoing engagement.

DATA QUALITY AND QAQC:
Assay work completed by certified lab (ALS Minerals).
QAQC protocol includes blanks, standards, and duplicates at 1:20 insertion rate.
QA/QC results show acceptable performance.
Core photography and logging completed to industry standards.
Some historical data from 1980s lacks proper QAQC documentation.
